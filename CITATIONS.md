## AI Assistance

The following aspects of this project were developed with the assistance of AI:

1. **Code Generation**
   - Creation of boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors)
   - Implementation of .cpp files based on header files
   - Auto-completion of method implementations

2. **Code Review and Advice**
   - Guidance on implementing transformation methods
   - Suggestions for improving code structure and organization
   - Advice on writing and structuring tests
   - Recommendations for handling edge cases
   - Suggestions for optimizing data structure implementations

3. **Documentation**
   - Assistance in writing clear and comprehensive documentation
   - Suggestions for improving code comments
   - Help in explaining complex mathematical concepts
   - Guidance on documenting data structure design decisions

4. **Debugging Support**
   - Help in identifying and fixing compilation errors
   - Suggestions for improving code efficiency
   - Guidance on proper error handling
   - Assistance with memory management issues

5. **Code Standards Compliance**
   - Enforcement of C++ core guidelines
   - Automatic fixing of code to meet C++ best practices
   - Suggestions for improving code safety and maintainability
   - Guidance on proper use of smart pointers and RAII

## AI Usage Policy

The AI assistance was used in accordance with the following principles:
- All code was reviewed and verified by the developer
- AI suggestions were adapted to fit the project's specific needs
- Core algorithms and business logic were implemented by the developer
- AI was primarily used for boilerplate code and debugging
- All data structure implementations and algorithms were developed by the student
- AI was used as a learning tool to understand best practices

## Tools Used

- Cursor IDE with AI-powered code completion
- AI-assisted code review and suggestions
- AI-powered documentation assistance
- C++ linters and static analyzers
