Objective
Create an interactive 2D scene editor that demonstrates scene graph data structures in action. The editor will allow users to create basic shapes, organize them hierarchically, and manipulate them while observing how parent-child relationships affect transformations between objects.

Background
Scene graphs provide the backbone of many graphics applications, including game engines, graphic design software, and editors like Maya, Motion Builder, and Avid. Their hierarchical approach to organizing graphical elements mirrors how people naturally think about objects and their relationships in the physical space.

For instance, when a car moves in a scene, its wheels should rotate. Scene graphs establish parent-child relationships between objects. In this case, the car is the parent node, and the wheels are its children. If a user turns the car node, wheels automatically turn on with the parent. 

Proposed Solution
Overview
The implementation will include a 2D scene editor application that allows users to:

Create basic shapes (rectangles and circles)
Select and transform shapes using intuitive controls
Group objects to establish parent-child relationships
Observe how transformations propagate through the hierarchy
Primary Data Structure: Tree
This project implements the scene graph using a tree data structure. Each node in the tree represents a graphical object with properties for transformation (position, rotation, scale), visual attributes (shape type, color), and relationships (parent and children).

Trees are ideal for this application because they:

Naturally represent containment and hierarchical relationships
Allow efficient propagation of transformations from parents to children
Enable recursive operations like rendering and hit testing
Provide O(log n) access time for finding objects
Support intuitive organization of graphical elements
Scene graphs are advantageous over data structures such as arrays or linked lists because they require manual tracking of object relationships and complex transformation calculations, significantly increasing code complexity and computational overhead. Graphs would be too general, potentially allowing cycles that do not make logical sense for parent-child relationships in a scene.

Implementation Components
Scene Node Class
Contains transformation properties, parent reference, and child collection.
Implements methods for tree traversal and transformation propagation
Handles local-to-global coordinate conversions
Transformation System
Implements basic matrix operations for combining transformations
Propagates changes through the hierarchy.
Provides utility functions for common operations (translate, rotate, scale)
Interactive Interface
A canvas for direct visualization and manipulation
Tree view showing the hierarchical structure
Tools for creating, selecting, and transforming objects
Challenges
Transformation Mathematics
Implementing the matrix operations 
Ensuring correct propagation through the hierarchy
Converting between local and global coordinate spaces
Strategy: Start with simple transformations and gradually add complexity; use existing libraries for matrix math if necessary
Selection and Interaction
Detecting which object was clicked when objects overlap
Managing the selection of both individual objects and groups
Creating intuitive controls for transformations
Strategy: Implement depth-first traversal for hit testing; use visual feedback for selection state
Performance Considerations
Efficiently updating transformations when objects move.
Optimizing tree traversal for operations like rendering
Strategy: Use dirty flags to avoid unnecessary recalculations; implement render culling for efficiency
Expected Outcomes
The completed project will demonstrate:

A working scene graph implementation managing parent-child relationships
Visual feedback showing how transformations affect hierarchies of objects
The ability to organize objects into logical groups
How tree traversal can efficiently apply operations to multiple objects
It will also include:

Implementation of the scene graph data structure
Interactive editor application with basic shape-creation tools
Transformation tools (move, rotate, scale) that properly handle hierarchies
Grouping/ungrouping functionality demonstrating parent-child relationships
Tree view visualization synchronized with the canvas view
Source code with extensive comments explaining the implementation
Documentation explaining design decisions and implementation challenges
